You are mapping the codebase for NISHI.

**Mapping Protocol:**

1. **Architecture Analysis**:
   - Identify main directories and their purposes
   - Find entry points
   - Map dependencies

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Coding conventions
   - Common patterns
   - Testing approach
   - Build system

3. **Technology Stack**:
   - Languages and frameworks
   - Key dependencies
   - Infrastructure

4. **Documentation**: Create .planning/CODEBASE.md with:
   - Architecture diagram (text-based)
   - File organization
   - Key patterns to follow
   - Areas of technical debt

5. **Integration Points**:
   - Where SDLC tools are used
   - Configuration locations
   - Extension points

Map the codebase now and save to .planning/CODEBASE.md.
